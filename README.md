# Segment Profitability & Cost Structure Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes segment-level profitability to identify the primary drivers of value creation and value destruction within a multi-segment business. Using aggregated sales, discount, cost, and profit data, 
the analysis evaluates which business dimensions most strongly explain profit margin variation and isolates the underlying economic drivers.

The results show that profitability differences are driven primarily by **cost structure rather than pricing or product mix**, with one segment operating at a structurally unprofitable cost base.
Counterfactual scenarios are used to quantify both the theoretical upside and the minimum viable operating threshold for improvement.

## Key Questions
- Which business segments are most and least profitable?
- What explains profit margin differences across segments?
- Are losses driven by pricing, product mix, or cost structure?
- What is the economic impact if an unprofitable segment reaches break-even or best-in-class efficiency?

## Key Findings
- **Segment** is the most explanatory dimension of profitability.
- Discount rates are relatively consistent across segments.
- Cost-of-goods-sold (COGS) varies significantly by segment and drives margin differences.
- The Enterprise segment operates at a structurally unprofitable cost base.
- If Enterprise reached break-even, company-wide profit would increase modestly.
- If Enterprise operated at the most efficient internal cost structure, profitability would improve substantially.
