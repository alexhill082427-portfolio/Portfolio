    "## Problem Statement    \n",
    "This analysis examines profitability across business segments to identify which segments create or destroy value. Using segment-level cost and pricing data, the analysis isolates the drivers of profitability differences and evaluates whether losses in the weakest-performing segment are attributable to pricing, product mix, or operating cost structure. A counterfactual scenario is used to quantify the financial impact if the unprofitable segment operated under a more efficient cost model."
